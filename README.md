# Encryption-Decryption

**Step 2 (ongoing):**

_Write a program that reads an English message and an integer number (**key**) from the standard input and shifts each letter by the specified number according to its order in the alphabet._

_If you reach the end of the alphabet, start back at the beginning (**a** follows **z**)._

_The program should not modify non-letter characters._

***
**Step 1:**

_For the first stage, you need to manually encrypt the message **"we found a treasure!"** and print the ciphertext (in lower case)._

_To encrypt the message, replace each letter with the letter that is in the corresponding position from the end of the English alphabet (a→z, b→y, c→x, ... x→c, y →b, z→a). Do not replace spaces or the exclamation mark._

_Use the given template to your program to print the ciphertext instead of the original message._

_The output should look like ## ##### # ########! where **#** is a lower-case English letter._
